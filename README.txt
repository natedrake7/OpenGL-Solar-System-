This project utilizes the OpenGL library,by which a world is created with a planet at the center and around it cubes.The planet and the cubes have textures and the planet
acts as a lightsource,lighting the cubes around it.The cubes rotate around the planet and themselves(each with a different way).By the lighting of the planet,shadows are created on the cubes.More details about the functionality of the project lie below.



Build Errors:
If you encounter build errors ,during the build of the solution,there are detailed ways for the installation(Installation.txt) of the glfw and assimp libraris which are the 
only ones that may not work from one computer to another.

Functionality: 

1)Camera Movement (WASD) and Sprint(WASD + LShift).

2)Pause of the World Movement by using Space

3)Exit the Project by using Esc.

4)Increase the rotatory speed of the cubes around the planet (left arrow for counterclockwise,right arrow for clockwise).

5)Increase the rotatory speed of the cubes around themselves(Left arrow + LShift for counterclockwise,Right arrow + LShift for clockwise).

6)Increase the speed of the whole solar system(kind of..if you consider cubes planets).To increase the speed counterclockwise use the down arrow 
and for clockwise the up arrow.

7)Increase the rotatory speed of the planet around itself (counterclockwise with down arrow  + LShift,clockwise with up arrow + LShift).
